   <p>The human being have always made use of its natural surroundings, not only for sustanance but also as medicine. My own journey with natural medicine came about after trying x amounts of prescribed medicine which either came with a whole lot of sideeffects, or did not sufficiently target my pain. The lists provided here are strictly my personal trial and error with these ingredients. I`ve also included my go to natural medicine for easier ailments such as a cold and general unwellness.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>herbs</li>
    <li>mushrooms</li>
    <li>fruit</li>
    <!--here im thinking of simple things like taking a walk in nature, sit in the sun and feel the earth underneath you.-->
    <li>what else is there?</li>
   </ul>

    <h3>herbs</h3>
    <p>My first and foremost go to herb whenever I`m feeling under the weather is <i>Thyme</i>. I have used both fresh and dried thryme to brew a cup of tea, I find they both work wonders. Although I do not use fresh full boiled water as it`s too hot and therefor at risk of destroying the beneficial oils.</p>
    <h3>mushrooms</h3>
    <p>If you can find <i>Chaga</i>, it is a mushroom boosting with nutrients beneficial to good health. Also, a tincture, i.e. an alcoholic solution of dried <i>Amanita Muscaria</i> caps will, when used topically, alliviate painful muscles, joints and tendons in the body.</p>
    <h3>fruit</h3>
    <p>Here I specifically refer to apples, and <i>Apple Cider Vinegar</i>. It can easily be made at home and it`s boosting with immune stimulating properties.</p>

  <h3>Other ways to make use of nature in natural healing?</h3>
  <p>Make sure you go outside everyday to soak up the fresh weather, wether it be rain or sunshine. Nothing heals our mental health more than to immerse oneself in nature.</p>
